# train_builder
Build and customize hypothetical trains

Runs through the console. The purpose of this program is to make sure the train is not too heavy for the current rail conditions. It constructs an initial Engine for the train, and then train cars can be added at any point during the program. These cars can have containers that are either "trapezoidal" or "cylindrical." The containers are filled with contents (whose properties are described in the Contents class). The main menu displays some options for the user to display different types of data about the current train. Each time the program checks if the train is too heavy for the given rail conditions.
